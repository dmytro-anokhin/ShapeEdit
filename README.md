# ShapeEdit

ShapeEdit is a showcase for [Advanced ScrollView](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/advanced-scrollview), inspired by WWDC sample with the same name. ShapeEdit is build in SwiftUI, with exception of the scroll view, that is `UIScrollView` or `NSScrollView` under the hood.

ShapeEdit contains some shapes that can be interacted with on a fixed size canvas. You can:
- Drag shapes around;
- Resize shapes;
- Create new shapes;
- On macOS scroll view will autoscroll to follow the coursor;
- Zoom in/out.

I'm working on improving interactions and adding features to make it more or less working vector editing tool.

You need Xcode 13 to run it.
