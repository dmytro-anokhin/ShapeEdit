# ShapeEdit

ShapeEdit is a showcase for [Advanced ScrollView](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/advanced-scrollview), inspired by WWDC sample with the same name.

ShapeEdit contains some shapes that can be dragged and resized on a fixed size canvas. I'm working on improving interactions and adding necessary features.

You need Xcode 13 to run it.
