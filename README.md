# ShapeEdit

ShapeEdit is a showcase for [Advanced ScrollView](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/advanced-scrollview), inspired by WWDC sample with the same name. ShapeEdit is build in SwiftUI, with exception of the scroll view, that is `UIScrollView` or `NSScrollView` under the hood.

ShapeEdit contains some shapes that can be interacted with on a fixed size canvas. You can:
- Drag shapes around;
- Resize shapes;
- On macOS scroll view will autoscroll to follow the coursor;
- Zoom in/out.

I'm working on improving interactions and adding features to make it more or less working vector editing tool.

You need Xcode 13 to run it. Currently the app only works correctly on macOS.
